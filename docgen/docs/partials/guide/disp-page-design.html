<p>An CRUD application needs a place to display and update the <code>Tables</code> that belong to the application.
They may be considered as the primary page of an application.
The <a href="/guide/appname-html">appname-html</a> along with the
<a href="/guide/appname-js">appname-js</a> specifies how these pages are constructed.</p>

<p>The <strong>Triangular</strong> standard design has a small title at the top, a menu on the left and a variable work section that varies based on what section is
current.  This implemented with extensive use of the <a href="/guide/templates">templates</a> and <a href="/api/tri.directive:macro">macro</a> facilities.</p>

<p>In addition a section for error or informative messages is placed just under the title.  This section is easily removed by the user and shows again
when the message changes.</p>

<p>Nothing in <strong>Triangular</strong> restricts the design of the display pages.  There is, however, potentially some reliance on the menu system to provide a means
of transitioning between tables views, table actions and logged on/logged off states.  An equivalent would have to be included.</p>

<p>See also the <a href="/guide/form-page-design">Form Page Design</a> page for design guidelines on print pages (application secondary pages).</p>

<p>The <a href="/guide/appsconfig">AppsConfig,js</a> file provides system configuration and should be loaded by the display page
as shown in the <a href="/guide/appname-html">appname-html</a> section.</p></div>
