<p>An CRUD application needs a place to display and print various views of the <code>Tables</code> that belong to the application.  The <code>FormHello.htm</code>, <code>FormCheque.htm</code> and <code>FormDeposit.htm</code>
are examples of this type of page.  They may be considered the secondary pages of an application.  The corresponding <code>FormHello.js</code>, <code>FormCheque.js</code> and <code>FormDeposit.js</code> provide
local functions that handle the needs of the Form Page.</p>

<p>The <strong>Triangular</strong> standard design places a menu at the extreme right (off the printable area of the page) which allows for the page
to have multiple renderings using <a target=_blank href="http://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a> to transition the sections.</p>

<p>The window <code>print</code> function is used to print the 'printable area' of the page.</p>

<p>To deal with cross-domain browser limitations, the windows messaging/post system is used to move data from the primary page to the secondary page.
This saves memory and also
makes cache management easier (only the primary window has to be synchronized).</p>

<p>The links <a href="/apps/hello-app#FormHello.htm">FormHello.htm</a> and <a href="/apps/hello-app#FormHello.js">FormHello.js</a> gives a detailed explanation
of the interaction between the primary and secondary windows as well as other considerations in the design.</p>
