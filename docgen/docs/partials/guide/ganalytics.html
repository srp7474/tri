<p><strong>Triangular</strong> uses <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/">Google Analytics</a> to record the website visit patterns.  The built in code
makes it easy to add to your site with the following 2 steps.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Obtain your Google Analytics script code and replace the script code in <a href="/guide/appsconfig">AppsConfig.js</a> with what you obtained. It should
look the same apart from the tracking codes.</p></li>
<li><p>In any HTML file you wish to include analytic information insert the statements
<br><br>
<code>&lt;script src="AppsConfig.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code> (If not already added)
<br>
<code>&lt;script&gt;gaTracking();&lt;/script&gt;</code></p></li>
</ol>

<p>This will record any activity on the HTML page in which the above code is inserted.</p>

<p>In addition Google Analytics' <code>events</code> will be created whenever a <a href="/api/tri.directive:whenActive">whenActive</a> link is pressed.
This typicaly gives a good idea of how the visitor(s) are traversing the website.  It is especially important in sites that would otherwise
have only one page visit because the remainder of the page updating is done via AJAX calls.</p></div>
