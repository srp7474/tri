<div><h3 id="overview">Overview</h4>

<p>This page contains a random collection of hints and/or techniques that were discovered during development and which are worthwhile to document.</p>

<h3 id="browserrelated">Browser Related</h4>

<h5 id="chromebrowser">Chrome Browser</h6>

<p>The development environment used was Chrome under Windows XP.  The Chrome browser has server developer friendly features that may or may not be present in other browsers.
Since at this stage of development emphasis was on functionality of the system the use of other browsers was not explored.</p>

<h5 id="useofchromeinspect">Use of Chrome inspect</h6>

<p>The use of the <code>View Source</code> facility is worthless in the <strong>Triangular</strong> (or <a target=_blank href="http://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a>) environment because it shows the source before insertion of the templates.
The <code>inspect element</code> right click on an element
causes Chrome to display the expanded elements as they are current in the Browser.  The <strong>Triangular</strong> template engine inserts markers
for each piece of HTML generated so the source can be tracked and the place where is it manufactured/modified can be determined.</p>

<h5 id="logfunction">log function</h6>

<p>A simple <code>log</code> function was implemented into the 'ut.js' file that forwards the calls to the browser <code>console.log</code> function.
This design allowed for an easy on/off switch based on the presence in localStorage of a '.log' property.</p>

<p>The extensive use of the %o in the display strings allows the display of objects.  For arrays a hidden object was sometimes created <code>{array:xxx}</code> so that
the default action to expand the array was avoided.</p>

<p>Note that when a display for an object thus shown is expanded, it shows the current value of the object, not the one at time of logging.</p>

<p>This can be made visible with the shortcut key &amp;LT:Ctl Shift J></p>

<h5 id="useoftrijs">Use of <code>TRi.js</code></h6>

<p>If there is an error in the <code>Tri.min.js</code> code, replacement of the reference in the relevant <code>.htm</code> file with <code>TRI.js</code>, pressing <strong>&LT;REFRESH></strong>
and rerunning the test will pinpoint the place of error in code that is more readable and may give clues as to the cause of the problem.  Remember to
change it back to <code>TRI.min.js</code> (performance).</p>

<h5 id="chromeinteractiveconsole">Chrome Interactive Console</h6>

<p>Commands can be entered into the console area.  Thus <code>$("div#editor")</code> will display the HTML string for the editor.</p>

<p>In addition the <code>fmt(html string)</code> will format the string to make it easier to read.</p>

<h3 id="atarget_blankhrefhttpangularjsorgangularjsarelated"><a target=_blank href="http://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a> Related</h4>

<h5 id="useofinputtypehiddenngmodel">Use of <code>&lt;input type=hidden ng-model=...&gt;</code></h6>

<p>In the 'Deps.htm' file a function was used to compute a value.  This was stored in a hidden field and made part of the ng-model with the result
that the dependant fields were automatically updated by <a target=_blank href="http://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a>.</p>

<h5 id="delayedschedulingofddigestcycles">Delayed Scheduling of $digest cycles</h6>

<p>Upon occasion, especially where external events occur, it is necessary to schedule a $digest cycle at the completion of the event handler.
The statement <code>setTimeout(function(){$rootScope.$digest()},0);</code> when executed does this against the entire page.  Use of <code>$scope</code> rather than <code>$rootScope</code> would
limit the $digest cycle to just the current scope (if known).</p>

<h5 id="htmlpagethisdscope">HTML Page this === $scope</h6>

<p>On an HTML page the <strong>this</strong> value is equivalent to <strong>$scope</strong> in the Javascript routines.  This feature is extensively used to pass in the <code>$scope</code> to
common routines, especially the <a href="/api/tri.object.Col">Col</a> and <a href="/api/tri.object.Table">Table</a> methods.</p>

<h5 id="useofdirectives">Use of directives</h6>

<p>Directives were frequent found to be a means to concisely solve user interface problems.  It is suggested that the use of directives be learned, especially
in the  the simpler cases.  See <a href="/guide/directives">directives</a>.</p>

<h5 id="nestedalteronfetch">Nested alter= on fetch</h6>

<p>This is used in <code>AppsBase.htm</code> when template a containing <code>macro</code> directives will itself be inserted by a <code>macro</code> directive
as is the case with <code>apps-body.html</code>.  The <code>alter=</code> attribute is used to change a value to itself. Then the outer macro
changes the alter string to the desired value using the '!' syntax because of the intermediate '/'.</p>

<p>This is used by <code>Deps.htm</code>  to change <code>SINGLE</code> to <code>DOUBLE</code> and <code>ctrlCommEdit</code> to <code>ctrlDepsEdit</code></p>

<h5 id="useofdeval">Use of $eval</h6>

<p>In order to pick up a string from a definition and delay the evaluation until the HTML is parsed the <code>$eval</code> function can be used.
For example in the 'AppsBase.htm' file the statement fragment <code>&lt;a class='c-action sz-90' href="" ng-class='$eval(oA.whatClass)' ...&gt;</code>
causes the string extracted from <code>oA.whatClass</code> to be evaluated and returned as the <code>ng-class</code> value.</p>

<h5 id="useofobjectsasmodels">Use of Objects as models</h6>

<p>The <a target=_blank href="http://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a> models behave best when they are dealing with an object.
In that way only the object reference has to be added to the $scope and the underlying HTML
can easily reference the property fields of the object.
This is shown clearly in the example code in <a href="/apps/chqs-app#Chqs.htm">Chqs.htm Line 143 ...</a>.</p>

<h3 id="triangularrelated">Triangular Related</h4>

<h5 id="useofleadingnottrailinginlists">Use of leading ',' not trailing ',' in lists</h6>

<p>A pattern used extensively in the code when there are lists that exceed lines is to add the next one with a leading ',' as opposed to a trailing ','.
This makes it easier to add, delete and comment out entries without having to sometimes remember to fix up the previous entry.</p>

<p>For example:
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
  var oTabProp = {
       recTitle: 'Messages'
      ,recName:  'messages'
      ,recType:  'msg'
      ,lsName:   '-msgs'
      ...
</pre>

<h5 id="minimaluseofmouseforinputintensiveapplications">Minimal use of mouse for input intensive applications</h6>

<p>In the 'Deps.htm' and 'Deps.js' files the <a href="/api/tri.directive:autotab">autotab</a> and <a href="/api/tri.directive:blurEvent">blurEvent</a> directives are
used to move the cursor to the most likely next input field.  As a result a standard input cycle can be completed with just one mouse click.</p>

<h5 id="makingicons">Making Icons</h6>

<p><strong>Triangular</strong> uses several Favorite Icons so, with multiple tabs open, it is easy to know which tab to select.</p>

<p>The general pattern is the base triangle of 3 colors with a white (primary) or blue (secondary) letter displayed in the middle.  The present lettering scheme
is:</p>

<ul>
<li>A - Admin app</li>
<li>B - Boot page</li>
<li>C - Chqs App</li>
<li>D - Deps App</li>
<li>M - Hello app (messages)</li>
<li>S - Source Display</li>
<li>T - Triangular documentation</li>
</ul>

<p>An additional 6 are provided as a convenience for use during app development numbered 1 thru 3 in white and blue.</p>

<ul>
<li><code>fav-t1w.ico</code> Number 1 white</li>
<li><code>fav-t1b.ico</code> Number 1 blue</li>
<li><code>fav-t2w.ico</code> Number 2 white</li>
<li><code>fav-t2b.ico</code> Number 2 blue</li>
<li><code>fav-t3w.ico</code> Number 3 white</li>
<li><code>fav-t3b.ico</code> Number 3 blue</li>
</ul>

<p>The free software GIMP 2 is used to make them.  The base information is in the <code>icons</code> folder distributed with the development package.
The steps are:</p>

<ol>
<li>open gimp2</li>
<li>open <code>tri-base2.xrf</code></li>
<li>Set to text, set font to sans-bold sz 550, white</li>
<li>enter letter, adjust to centered position</li>
<li>Merge layers</li>
<li>Select portion left corner 148:135 size 714:714</li>
<li>crop to selection</li>
<li>export as .PNG file</li>
<li>Use fill tool</li>
<li>change to colour blue</li>
<li>fill white number</li>
<li>export as .PNG file</li>
<li>Close view without destroying <code>tri-base2.xrf</code></li>
<li>goto website http://tools.dynamicdrive.com/favicon</li>
<li>Choose file</li>
<li>press Create Icon</li>
<li>press DownLoad FavIcon</li>
</ol>

<h5 id="accessingdataondatastorelocalcopy">Accessing Data on Datastore (Local copy)</h6>

<p>On the local machine can use the <a target=_blank href=http://localhost:8882/_ah/admin>Datastore Viewer</a> to see your raw data.  Use the class
<code>com.rsi.cita.gdo.GdoCitaData</code>.</p>

<h5 id="accessingdataondatastoreviadatastoreviewer">Accessing Data on Datastore via Datastore Viewer</h6>

<p>This is accessed from your Google App Signin Page.</p>

<p>The standard GQL will access upto 20 records.</p>

<p><code>SELECT * FROM com.rsi.cita.gdo.GdoCitaData</code></p>

<p>To restrict by application use:</p>

<p><code>SELECT * FROM com.rsi.cita.gdo.GdoCitaData where KeyName &gt; 'deps/' and KeyName &lt; 'deps9'</code></p>

<p>where <code>deps</code> is the application in question</p>

<p>To restrict by application and record type use:</p>

<p><code>SELECT * FROM com.rsi.cita.gdo.GdoCitaData where KeyName &gt; 'deps/donors/' and KeyName &lt; 'deps/donors9'</code></p>

<p>where <code>deps</code> is the application and <code>donors</code> is the record type in question</p>

<p>To just see the KeyName use</p>

<p><code>SELECT KeyName FROM com.rsi.cita.gdo.GdoCitaData</code></p>
