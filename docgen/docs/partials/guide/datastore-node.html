<p>The Datastore is the  facility used to persist the data of the applications.</p>

<p>In the <strong>Triangular</strong> Node.js variant of the development configuration this is provided by the <a href="/guide/server-inter#nodejsvariant">Server Node.js Variant</a>.
Both the local development environment and the production
deployed version use the same scheme.  In fact the deploying into production of a local development environment uses the local data structure as its starting point.</p>

<p><strong>Triangular</strong> deploys its <a href="/guide/nodesite">NodeJS Site</a> at
<a target=_blank href=https://www.nodejitsu.com>NodeJitsu  Node.js Hosting</a></p>

<p>Both local and production use the same data structure.  The default base name is TRI-DB within the deployed structure.  Each app is stored within
a folder of the app name.</p>

<p>Each <a href="/guide/records#keystructure">Record Key/Data</a> file is stored  as one of  3 types.</p>

<ul>
<li><code>$super</code> - the <a href="/guide/user#superuser">SuperUser</a> credentials</li>
<li><code>$user</code> - <a href="/guide/user#adminuser">AdminUsers</a> and <a href="/guide/user">Users</a> within the respective apps folder.  The <code>role:admin</code> distuinguishes them.</li>
<li><code>$data</code> - the data records.</li>
</ul>

<p>During startup the <a href="/guide/node-server">NodeJS Server</a> loads the directory structure into an internal table.  The <code>db</code> command may be used to see this
if the local console has been turned on with the <code>-quit</code> option.</p>

<p>The <strong>Node.js</strong> single threaded architecture made the potential file contention issue a non-issue.  Whenever a record is to be physically written a copy is placed into
the <code>rec.data</code> field of the structure and the write started. When the write completes the <code>rec.data</code> field is cleared.  If a read occurs during the time
the <code>rec.data</code> field has a value this value is returned to the requester immediately.  Otherwise a normal read takes place and the contents returned to the requester
when it completes.</p>

<p>The <code>GekID</code> field is ignored and set to a value of <code>1</code>.</p>

<p>The <code>CreateTS</code> and <code>UpdateTS</code> fields are derived from the <strong>Node.js</strong> <code>fs.stat</code> command using the
<code>ctime</code> and <code>mtime</code> values converted to milliseconds using <code>getTime()</code>.</p>

<p>The passwords on the system are encrypted using a <code>mangle</code> property in the <a href="/guide/user#superuser">SuperUser</a>  that is randomly created when the
<a href="/guide/user#superuser">SuperUser</a> is created.  This value should not be changed without resetting all the passwords. The randomness of this string
makes it difficult to derive the password even if the encrytped value is known. The <code>mangle</code> value should be kept secret for this reason.</p></div>
