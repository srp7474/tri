<div><h3 id="overview">Overview</h4>

<p>The <strong>WAKS Utility</strong> is a program provided in the development package to transfer data files between the development computer and a server.</p>

<p>It relies on special commands on the server.  To prevent illegal access the <a href="/guide/user#superuser">SuperUser</a> userid and password must be provided with each invocation.</p>

<p>There are two versions of the program.  The first, written in Java, should be used to access the <a href="/guide/variants">GAE Servers</a>.  The second,
written in Node.js, should be used to access the <a href="/guide/variants">Node.js Servers</a>.  The reason for this is that in spite of the fact the command set is
indentical there is an underlying incompatibility in the headers sent automatically be the respective language support code that was not productive to
troubleshoot.</p>

<p>The <code>waks.bat</code> utility determines which version is being accessed and uses the appropriate version of the program.</p>

<h3 id="requirements">Requirements</h4>

<ul>
<li>Java (at least version 6)  installed on the computer (<a href="/guide/variants">Java Variant</a>)</li>
<li>Node.js  installed on the computer (<a href="/guide/variants">Node.js Variant</a>)</li>
<li>Windows XP or more.  Could use other operating systems if the <code>WAKS.bat</code> command file was replaced with an equivalent for the host operating system.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="waksbaturls"><code>WAKS.bat</code> URLs</h4>

<p>Two URLs are coded inside the <code>WAKS.bat</code> file.  The first is the local server address used when the <code>WAKS</code> command does not contain the <strong>prod</strong> prefix.
For the <a href="/guide/variants">Java Variant</a> this is set to <code>localhost:8882</code>.
For the <a href="/guide/variants">Node.js Variant</a> this is set to <code>localhost:8888</code>.
These are set inside server start files <code>run-ws.bat</code> and <code>run-tri.bat</code> for the <a href="/guide/variants">Java Variant</a> and <a href="/guide/variants">Node.js Variant</a> respectively.
If they are changed in the server startup .bat file they should be changed in the <code>waks.bat</code> file also.</p>

<p>The second is the production URL set with the <code>waks site</code> command.  This also determines which variant of the <code>WAKS</code> utility to use.
This second URL is used when the <code>WAKS</code> command contains the <strong>prod</strong> prefix.</p>

<h3 id="fileandkeyconversionprotocol">File and Key Conversion Protocol</h4>

<p>Keys on the server use an '*'  as part 1 of the key for User records and the '/' character as a separator between each part.</p>

<p>These are converted into a '$' and '-' respectivly when the Key is used to derive the file name on the local file system.  In addition the
'.json.txt' string is added to the file name.</p>

<p>These transformations are handled automatically by the <code>WAKS</code> utility program.</p>

<h3 id="waksbatoptions"><code>WAKS.bat</code> Options</h4>

<p>The very latest options can be seen by typing <code>WAKS</code> with no options.</p>

<p>A number of settings needs to be established.  They are stored in environment variables.  Keywords, <strong>set</strong>, <strong>dir</strong> and <strong>site</strong>  are used to trigger
their respective values.</p>

<h5 id="setsetstheappidcustandthesuperusercredentials">set - sets the app id (cust) and the SuperUser credentials</h6>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
   WAKS set cust user password
</pre>

<p>This establishes the application ID and the SuperUser ID and password.  If your computer is shared set this to nulls afterwards so
that the SuperUser credentials are not compromised.  An application ID of '$' is used to access the User records.</p>

<h5 id="dirsetstheworkdirectory">dir - Sets the Work Directory</h6>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
  WAKS dir dirname
</pre>

<p>This establishes the working directory where files are shipped from and fetched into.</p>

<h5 id="sitesetstheproductionurl">site - Sets the Production URL</h6>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
  WAKS site site-type site-prefix
</pre>

<p>This establishes the URL used when the <strong>prod</strong> prefix is used in the <code>fetch</code> and <code>ship</code> access commands.  The <code>site-type</code> should be <code>gae</code> to access the <a href="/guide/gaesite">GAE Site</a>
and <code>jitsu</code> to access the <a href="/guide/nodesite">NodeJitsu Site</a>.  If you host at a different site then modify <code>waks.bat</code> by adding another <code>site-type</code>.</p>

<p>The <code>site-prefix</code> is the ID you have registered with the respective hosting site used to connect to your application.</p>

<h3 id="fetchingfilesfromtheserver">Fetching files from the server</h4>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
  WAKS [prod] type name [-r]
</pre>

<p>where</p>

<p><code>prod</code> if entered causes the production URL to be used.</p>

<p><code>type</code> the file type to fetch.  A % value will cause all types to be fetched.</p>

<p><code>name</code>  the 3rd part of the key.  A value of % will cause all files for <code>type</code> to be fetched.</p>

<p><code>-r</code>   If entered causes the local files to be replaced by the copy from the server. <b>Use with caution</b></p>

<h3 id="shippingfilesontotheserver">Shipping files onto the server</h4>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
  WAKS [prod] ship type name [-r]
</pre>

<p>where</p>

<p><code>prod</code> if entered causes the production URL to be used.</p>

<p><code>ship</code> Entered as <strong>ship</strong> to trigger the shipping of files rather than the fetching of files.</p>

<p><code>type</code> the file type to ship.  A % value will cause all types to be shipped.</p>

<p><code>name</code>  the 3rd part of the key.  A value of % will cause all files for <code>type</code> to be shipped.</p>

<p><code>-r</code>   If entered causes the local files to be replace the server versions. <b>Use with caution</b></p>

<h3 id="useofintypeandnameparameters">Use of % in <code>type</code> and <code>name</code> parameters</h4>

<p>A value of % causes all instances of that qualifier to be processed.</p>

<p>The <code>type</code> and <code>name</code> values can be partially qualified.  That is, a <code>name</code> value of <code>xxx%</code> would match
keys whose 3rd part begins with <code>xxx</code>.</p>

<p>If <code>type</code> contains a % the name parameter is required but its value is ignored.  This is because the type qualifier
precedes the name qualifier in the key.</p>

<h3 id="waksinternaloptions"><code>WAKS</code> Internal Options</h4>

<p>The very latest internal options can be seen by typing <code>WAKS</code> with no options.  The section at the end titled <code>WAKS Parameters</code> describes the internal <code>WAKS</code> program options
used by the <code>waks.bat</code> utility.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums">

<p>These options are generated by the <code>WAKS.bat</code> command file are are included here for reference.</p></div>
