<p>The software industry reports that the <strong>Dependency Injection</strong> design of <a target=_blank href="http://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a> has resulted in considerable
progress in reducing the programming workload for creating well behaved WEB pages.
Furthermore, the <strong>directive</strong> capability of <a target=_blank href="http://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a> is a powerful tool for extending the HTML capabilities used to create behavoirs
and render these same WEB pages.</p>

<p>For a typical CRUD application written in <a target=_blank href="http://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a>, <strong>Triangular</strong> can boost the coding productivity even more by factoring
out the common elements of such an application
into a reusable infrastructure.  The application specifics are provided by a simple javascript definition <a href="/guide/appname-js">AppName.js File</a>
and an HTML file <a href="/guide/appname-html">AppName.html File</a>.  Much of these two components is either boilerplate code or code that
has easy adapted patterns.</p>

<p><strong>Triangular</strong> derives its name from the fact that 3 components are required in the <strong>Triangular</strong> infrastructure:</p>

<ol>
<li>The <a target=_blank href="http://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a> codebase</li>
<li>The <strong>Triangular</strong> codebase</li>
<li>The application specific codebase</li>
</ol>

<p>For simple applications junior level programmers should be able to follow the patterns and make the required changes
with the help of this documentation.</p>

<h2 id="problemdomain">Problem Domain</h3>

<p>The typical CRUD application  (<b>C</b>reate/<b>R</b>ead/<b>U</b>pdate/<b>D</b>elete of records) requires the following capabilities:</p>

<ul>
<li>A User login capability</li>
<li>A Menu of actions based on the login profile</li>
<li>A filtered List capability to summarize selected records</li>
<li>An Edit capability to create a new record or update a record selected from the list</li>
<li>A Delete capability to remove a selected record</li>
<li>A set of views that display/print the records according to the authorization of the User</li>
<li>A datastore to persist the records.</li>
</ul>

<p>While essentially a single-page app, since the application HTML component uses the <a target=_blank href="http://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a> capabilities extensively
the infrastructure readily supports:</p>

<ul>
<li>multiple related tables per application</li>
<li>multiple views of each table</li>
<li>pages that use multiple related tables (See Deps application)</li>
</ul>

<p>While a level of security is provided by the server, since the bulk of the work is performed in the browser, there is a limit
to how secure the application is.  That is, a bright person intent on thwarting the security could perhaps be able to access
data beyond the role based restrictions.  The provided server does prevent updates to the user profiles used to control
these roles.  Furthermore, if necessary, the server could be extended to filter out the data sent to the client based
on role based criteria. With this in mind it is perhaps best to use other technologies for applications requiring a high level of
security such as banking applications.</p>

<p>Since the browser contains a working copy of the entire database, applications that deal in millions as opposed to
thousands of records are probably not candidates for this methodology.  This limitation could be relaxed if the application
was able to work with a subset of the data and the server was extended to add a filtering capability.</p>

<h2 id="architecture">Architecture</h3>

<p>The overall architecture could be described as thin server/fat client since the application business logic is hosted in the browser
and the server merely provides persistance and authentication.</p>

<h4 id="theserver">The Server</h5>

<p>The <a href="/guide/server-inter">server</a> provides the following services:</p>

<ul>
<li>Application Login</li>
<li>Autheticated AJAX services</li>
<li>Key based JSON object retrieval and update</li>
</ul>

<p>The two servers provided with <strong>Triangular</strong> are designed and ready to run.  The first runs in the <a href="/guide/gaesite">Google App Engine</a> environment.
The second, <code>tri-server.js</code> runs in the
<a href="/guide/nodesite">Node.js</a> envronment. Others such as a PHP based one could be modeled after the <code>tri-server.js</code> implementation.</p>

<h4 id="theclient">The Client</h5>

<p>The client consists of several interconnected components running inside a browser:</p>

<ul>
<li>The <code>&lt;a target=_blank href="http://angularjs.org/"&gt;AngularJS&lt;/a&gt;</code> codebase</li>
<li>The <code>tri.js</code> and other <strong>Triangular</strong> support code</li>
<li>The application specific javascript and HTML code</li>
</ul>

<p>The localStorage service provided by HTML5 compliant browsers is used extensively to cache the server datastore.
This design reduces bandwidth requirements and significantly improves system responsiveness.  The infrastructure provides
dirty data detection to maintain the synchronization of the cache and the server datastore.</p>

<p>For data display based pages the browser post message functionality is used to pass data from the main application page to
the secondary pages.  This design overcomes the cross-domain restrictions of modern browsers while simplifying the cache management
algorithms by
maintaining a current cache only in the main page.</p>

<p>By default User inactivity is detected and a User signed off after 5 minutes.  These parameters are easily customized on a user by user basis
or changed for the entire system.</p>

<h2 id="usage">Usage</h3>

<p>The application developer
adds the 2 component files, namely <a href="/guide/appname-html">AppName.html File</a> and <a href="/guide/appname-js">AppName.js File</a>, configures and optionally populates the server and the application is ready to run.</p>

<p>If special reporting formats is required two more files are added following the guidelines detailed in <a href="/guide/form-page-design">Form Page Design</a></p>

<h2 id="history">History</h3>

<p>I have always been a proponent of schema driven applications.  That is, the business logic for each field should be
closely tied to a single definition giving the field's location, format and constraints.
If practiced the following benefits should be realized:</p>

<ul>
<li>The contents and meaning of a field is easily understood</li>
<li>The application maintenance burden is reduced</li>
</ul>

<p>Over the years I have written applications using the following methodoligies and attempted to apply
this schema driven approach to that methodology:</p>

<ul>
<li>Velocity - an early HTML templating scheme</li>
<li>A handcrafted HTML parser and data driven templating scheme</li>
<li>JSPs and JQuery</li>
<li>Extended JSPs and JQuery</li>
<li>Drupal &amp; Joomla</li>
</ul>

<p>While there was limited success, several weaknesses of the methodologies were exposed by these attempts.  In part they can be
summarized as:</p>

<ul>
<li>All required knowledge of multiple languages (beyond HTML and CSS)</li>
<li>The splitting of the processing between the server and client complicated the design and especially the debugging of applications</li>
<li>The multiple layers used to render the HTML became difficult to formulate and debug (especially Drupal)</li>
<li>Creating user friendly interfaces was a major chore</li>
</ul>

<p>I heard about <a target=_blank href="http://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a> and it seemed to have the potential to address these weaknesses.
After writing several applications using <a target=_blank href="http://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a> I am
pleased to report that for the applications within the problem domain defined above
<a target=_blank href="http://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a> has made great strides in eliminating the weaknesses just enumerated above.</p>

<p>In order to learn <a target=_blank href="http://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a> I began work on 3 CRUD applications simultaneously.
I found I repeatedly had to retrofit improvements from one app into
the others.  Obviously there had to be a better way.</p>

<p>I realized that the flexibility of Javascript meant that I could define schemas using it's flexible language and
drive the applications from these definitions.  Thus <strong>Triangular</strong> was conceived.
The idea of dynamic tables found in Drupal and Jooma is also appealing.
However, while possible, the effort to go this extra step was deferred in the present implementation of <strong>Triangular</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Triangular</strong> takes the common elements from the CRUD app and moves them into a reusable infrastructure.
Design efforts were expended to maximize the customization capabilities of this reusable infrastructure.
The application data specfics are defined in a table that references application specific methods.</p></div>
