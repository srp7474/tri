<p>At this point we are making sure the plumbing is working.  Nothing in <code>MyApp</code> should be affected by the change in <code>application</code> that was
performed in <a href="/tutorial/step-06">Get GAE Site ID</a> point 2.</p>

<h3 id="validatemyapp">Validate <code>MyApp</code></h4>

<ol>
<li><p>If <code>MyApp</code> is intended to be the default app then access it with a browser with URL <code>localhost:8882</code></p></li>
<li><p>If <code>MyApp</code> is not intended to be the default app then access it with a browser with URL <code>localhost:8882/apps/MyApp.htm</code></p></li>
<li><p>If the demo apps are removed from the <code>x:\tri-devp\war\apps</code> folder then their use will cause <code>Error 404</code> to be displayed on the browser.</p></li>
<li><p>If they are not removed the signon page for each app will still be presented but it will be impossible to login.</p></li>
<li><p>If the intention was to keep them then each will need an <a href="/guide/user#adminuser">AdminUser</a> and <a href="/guide/user">User(s)</a> to be created as well
as the loading of the <a href="/guide/datastore">Datastore</a> using the <a href="/guide/waks">WAKS Utility</a> with the data provided in the
<code>x:\tri-devp\data</code> folder.</p></li>
